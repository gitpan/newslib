Revision history for Perl extension NewsLib

0.83b Thu Apr 22 10:50:44 CDT 2004 
	- Put News::Cancel back in as News::Article::Cancel.  It is now,
	  though, just a module that inherits News::Article.
	- Net::NNTP::Auth is now v1.0 (no real changes except docs)

0.82b Thu Mar 18 14:28:37 CST 2004 
	- Added News::Article::Clean.

0.81b Fri Feb 13 16:24:01 CST 2004 
	- Made News::Cancel into its own module, not a sub-version of
	  News::Article.  I'm not entirely happy with this, but it's a start.
